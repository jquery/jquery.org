    <h1>jQuery Foundation Credit Card Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>Q. Why is the jQuery Foundation offering a jQuery branded card when others exist? </h2>
    <p>A. Individuals have been requesting that The jQuery Foundation offer additional ways to support the community. The credit card is a great way of publicly showing your support for jQuery where 100% of proceeds go directly to sponsoring community technical events and travel grants for developers to accelerate jQuery innovation.</p>

    <h2>Q. How does opening a credit card with UMB benefit jQuery Foundation?</h2>
    <p>A. jQuery Foundation receives $50 for each approved application that is activated and used within 90 days of approval. Additionally, a percentage of every retail purchase made using the card will be donated to jQuery Foundation. 100% of those proceeds will go toward providing community technical events and travel funding.</p>

    <h2>Q. Who is UMB?</h2>
    <p>UMB a multi-bank, multi-billion dollar holding company headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, was recently ranked by Smart Money as "the highest-scoring traditional bank among our favorites." As a leading card issuer with nearly 40 years of credit card experience, UMB offers a wide range of consumer and commercial Visa and private label products. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.umb.com">www.umb.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Q. When I apply for the card, who collects the information and issues me the card?</h2>
    <p>A. Itâ€™s important to point out that there is no financial relationship between card applicants and The jQuery Foundation. The financial relationship card holders have is with Kansas City-based UMB. Approved applicants will receive a credit card from UMB, not The jQuery Foundation. The jQuery Foundation does not receive financial or personal information about any card applicants; this information is collected by UMB and is not passed to the jQuery Foundation.</p>

    <h2>Q. Is the jQuery Foundation sharing its contact lists with CardPartner or UMB?</h2>
    <p>A. No. The jQuery Foundation does not share its lists to CardPartner, UMB, or any other party. The jQuery Foundation makes available the credit card program, as a means to support the community, through our on-line sites and at our events.</p>

    <h2>Q. Is there an annual fee?</h2>
    <p>A. No, there is no annual fee.</p>

    <h2>Q. What is the interest rate on the card?</h2>
    <p>A. 0% for the first six month introductory period on purchases and balance transfers. After the six month introductory period, the interest rate will be the federal prime rate +8.74%.</p>

    <h2>Q. Can I apply over the phone?</h2>
    <p>A. Unfortunately, not at this time.</p>

    <h2>Q. How can I get an application by mail?</h2>
    <p>A. Paper applications will be available at certain jQuery Foundation events. We encourage you to apply securely online to help us reduce marketing and processing costs.</p>

    <h2>Q. When I apply for the card, will my transaction be secure?</h2>
    <p>A. Yes. Your application will be transmitted to UMB through an encrypted security page.</p>

    <h2>Q. Do I have to activate and use the card within a certain time period for the jQuery Foundation to receive the $50?</h2>
    <p>A. Yes. But you only need to use the card once within the first 90 days for us to receive the $50 bounty. Of course, we encourage you to make it your primary card because jQuery Foundation receives a percentage of every retail purchase at no additional cost to you.
