If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to the jQuery Foundation by emailing [conduct@jquery.org](mailto:conduct@jquery.org). **All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:

*   Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
*   Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
*   When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
*   Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.  Screenshots can be useful in the case something is edited or deleted before action is taken.
*   Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
*   If you believe this incident is ongoing.
*   Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

Reports will receive urgent and immediate attention from the Code of Conduct Committee. Please refer to the [Enforcement Manual](https://jquery.org/conduct/enforcement-manual) for the complete information on how reports will be processed. Though normally considered an internal document, it has been published in full in the interest of transparency.

### Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the committee, contact the jQuery Foundation President and Executive Director at [executive@jquery.org](mailto:executive@jquery.org) with your appeal and they will review the case.
