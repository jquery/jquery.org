		<p>For years, the jQuery Foundation has supported the development,
		 growth and administration of the jQuery projects as well as non-jQuery
		 projects like QUnit, Sizzle and Globalize with the goal of making the
		 open web accessible to everyone. With that goal in mind, the jQuery
		 Foundation has opened its doors to other open source projects that are
		 dedicated to that same mission and are vital pieces to the open web
		 ecosystem. But what does that mean for your project and what would
		 your project get out of joining the jQuery Foundation? Those are good
		 questions that we hope to answer here.</p>

			<h1>What do we offer our projects?</h1>
			<p>When your project joins the Foundation, we'll take care of the
				 administrative, legal, financial, infrastructure and other
				 tasks so that the development team can focus on the project
				 and their community.</p>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Administration and Governance</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Projects enter the jQuery Foundation in different states. If
					 necessary, we will help a project determine their team
					 structure, leadership and communication infrastructure. The
					 Foundation does not micromanage the technical direction of
					 the project, leaving direction to the project team and its
					 community.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Community</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The jQuery Foundation has years of experience building and
					 nurturing a community around its projects and we want to
					 give you access to that experience. Whether your project is
					 new or established, you can always work toward growing your
					 community and making sure you are meeting their needs. We
					 want to help you do that.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Projects will have access to jQuery Foundation hardware and
					 services as well as a team dedicated to keeping it all
					 running. The Foundation will provide resources for websites,
					 documentation, builds, CDN access and more. We also have an
					 ever growing stock of mobile devices available for project
					 testing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Financial Management</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Whether or not your project currently brings in funding, we
					 are here to help. All of our projects share in a single
					 budget. Based on available funds, project goals/needs and
					 a group prioritization system, we allocate those funds in
					 the best way possible for all projects. This means that
					 large projects with a good funding base, like jQuery for
					 example, receive help in allocating that money most
					 effectively and they also help smaller or less funded
					 projects continue to move forward.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Legal Assistance</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The jQuery Foundation will register and protect any
					 trademarks and intellectual property belonging to a project
					 and will protect all projects under jQuery Foundation
					 copyright. The Foundation will also provide or help with
					 the creation of a Contributor License Agreement for each
					 project as well as license selection and management.
					 Projects have access to our legal team as well if the need
					 arises.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Open Web Forum</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Our projects are accepted because we believe they are
					 important to the open web and its future. With that in
					 mind, we provide vendor-neutral forums such as mailing
					 lists and other communication channels as well as in person
					 meetings and conferences for our projects to collaborate
					 and work together toward common goals as well as pull from
					 the experiences and knowledge of those other projects. We
					 think this is a unique and very important advantage of
					 being part of the jQuery Foundation. Your project is not
					 siloed but instead encouraged to be a contributing part of
					 the Foundation ecosystem.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Project Autonomy</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The Foundation's goal is to provide Open Source projects with
					 the financial, logistical, and administrative resources they
					 need to ensure each project is successful. If a project's
					 leadership wishes to leave the Foundation at some point in
					 the future, it is free to do so. The Foundation will transfer
					 relevant marks and copyrights to a nonprofit organization
					 that is committed to respecting the open source license of
					 the project. The jQuery projects made a similar transition
					 from the Software Freedom Conservancy in 2012 when the jQuery
					 Foundation was created.</p>

			<h1>How does a project get started?</h1>
			<p>The Foundation offers projects support without micro-managing
				 their technical decisions, and sets a few basic best practices
				 for all projects, such as tagging for all releases. Projects
				 determine their own release schedules, feature sets, team
				 members, and tool sets.</p>
			<p>So you've decided that your project would fit into the jQuery
				 Foundation family, great! We want to hear from you. We don't
				 have a set application procedure but we do have some guidelines
				 we follow when accepting new projects. Many projects won't meet
				 all of these guidelines, and that's ok. It's more about
				 providing talking points for the Foundation to get to know and
				 evaluate a potential project.</p>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Does a project "fit" with the other projects?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The Foundation wants to know if the goals and purpose of the
					 project fit into the community of projects we currently
					 support. We want our projects to benefit from each other
					 and provide a wealth of knowledge and experiences that they
					 can all draw from.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Is the project important to other projects and developers?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In many cases this means the project is already widely used,
					 and needs support so it can continue to grow and serve the
					 web development community. In a few cases it may mean that,
					 in the judgement of the Foundation, a small project is
					 important to the future of web development.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Is the project well maintained?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>It's great when a project maintains a consistent style and
					 organization to the code in their project. But more than
					 that, we want to see that there is a team of people,
					 large or small, that is willing to continue to grow and
					 maintain that project with the support of the Foundation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<h2>Is the project licensed under a liberal Open Source license?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>We prefer a small number of licenses like
					 <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT</a>
					 or BSD style licenses. We will consider other licenses but
					 our goal is to maintain the openness of a project and the
					 license must reflect that.</p>
