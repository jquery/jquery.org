		<p>Joining the jQuery Foundation has a couple of meanings. First, there is the act of a project becoming a jQuery Foundation project and benefiting from our open web ecosystem. If that's what you're looking for, check out the different <a href="/projects/">projects</a> that are already part of the foundation and see what it means to be a jQuery Foundation project.</p>
		<p>If you're looking to support the jQuery Foundation and the projects involved, this is the place for you. Members join the jQuery Foundation on an annual subscription basis. Corporate members receive benefits ranging from website recognition to conference sponsorships and more. To say thank you for your support at the individual level, we'll send you some gifts each year. See below for the other benefits our members enjoy.</p>
		<p>If you would like to support our mission at any level but don't want the recognition or gifts, head over to our <a href="/donate/">donation page</a> or <a href="mailto:info@jquery.org"</a>let us know</a> how you would like to help.</p>

	<h3>Corporate Membership</h3>
	<p>Membership in the jQuery Foundation supports our ongoing mission to make the open web accessible to everyone. The large majority of the Foundation's funding comes from memberships and as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization, all membership dues collected are invested back into realizing that mission through development of our projects, participation in standards bodies, collaboration with the development community and browser vendors, as well as hosting and running developer conferences.</p>
	<p>We have a number of corporate membership levels with varying benefits associated with each:</p>
