## Source Code

jQuery projects are released under the terms of the [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

The MIT License is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with a jQuery project.

You are free to use any jQuery project in any other project (even commercial projects) as long as the copyright header is left intact.

## Sample Code

All demos and examples, whether in a code project's repository or displayed on a jQuery site, are released under the terms of [CC0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC0#Zero_.2F_Public_domain).

CC0 is even more permissive than the MIT license, allowing you to use the code in any manner you want, without any copyright headers, notices, or other attribution.

## Web Sites

The content on jQuery web sites are released under the terms of the [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

**The design, layout, and look-and-feel of jQuery web sites are not licensed for use and may not be used on any site, personal or commercial, without prior written consent from the jQuery Foundation**.
