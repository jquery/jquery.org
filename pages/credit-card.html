    <p><img class="left noborder" src="/resources/cc.png" alt="jQuery Credit Card" /> The jQuery Foundation is pleased to offer a platinum rewards jQuery credit card for those who want to support the jQuery Foundation's activities while expressing their commitment to jQuery. The jQuery credit card is an easy way for anyone to contribute to the growth of jQuery and identify themselves as supporters of the community by carrying Tux in their pocket.</p>

    <p>The jQuery Foundation is partnering with CardPartner, Inc. to offer the affinity jQuery credit card through UMB Bank. For every card activation, the jQuery Foundation will receive $50 as well as a percentage of every purchase made with the jQuery credit card.</p>

    <p>All funds from the Visa card program will go directly toward providing community technical events and providing travel grants for open source community members in order to accelerate jQuery innovation.</p>

    <p>As a nonprofit organization funded primarily by member dues, the jQuery Foundation provides a variety of important services, not the least of which is supporting Linus Torvalds’ full-time work on the kernel. The jQuery credit card allows anyone to contribute to the community by enabling the Foundation to sustain and expand upon its important work.</p>

    <p>jQuery credit card members can earn bonus points redeemable towards free merchandise, airline tickets, and more at hundreds of online and neighborhood retailers.</p>

        <li>No annual fee</li>
