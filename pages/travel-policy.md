## Guiding Principle

Each dollar you spend under this policy exists to further the mission of the jQuery Foundation. These are special funds of a member-supported not-for-profit organization. The community has placed a trust in you as a team member to be reasonable and prudent in expending these resources.

## To Whom Does This Apply

If you are listed as a team member on https://jquery.org/team/ this policy applies to you. It applies equally to all members of the jQuery team, including directors, advisors, support staff, and team members.

If you are a speaker at a jQuery event, this policy does not apply to you, but a different one might. Talk to the person that invited you to be a speaker to see what is covered (if anything) and how to request it.

## When To Apply

Use this policy when you incur an expense on behalf of the jQuery Foundation in your capacity as a member of the jQuery Team. If you want to propose a covered expense or are not sure if an expense or trip is already budgeted or approved, ask the President or Executive Director.

If you or a company can help in covering some expenses that would otherwise be covered by this policy, that is a welcome donation. We want to recognize this donation, in whatever way it is made. If we aren't already recognizing it, talk to the President or Executive Director.

## Airfare

Coach fare, domestic and international. Get a direct flight if it's not outrageous compared to one connection. Two connections should only ever be needed if you find it to be the best of all options (not just to save a small amount of money). Shop around to make sure you're getting a good deal. Hipmunk is a handy site for that, and will sort trips by 'Agony'. Your happiness is very important to jQuery. Choose a flight that balances 'Agony' with price.

If adding a day or partial day at either or both ends of the trip makes the flight either cheaper or not much more expensive, and the trip more bearable, do that. Anything more than that should be considered out-of-policy (personal) and handled on your own.

Checked bags are covered by this policy when needed. You are encouraged to avoid baggage fees by using a carry-on when reasonable.

If you want to combine an in-policy trip with an out-of-policy trip that ends up making it cheaper or more expensive, figure out the cost the in-policy trip would be on its own and use the lower of the two amounts when requesting reimbursement.

## Hotel

Get a nice room in a nice location and good wifi. Wifi is covered by this policy even if it is not included with the standard room fee. Nothing luxurious, but not a dump (not 1 star and not 5 stars). If you don't mind sharing a room with someone that's travelling under the same policy, that will save some resources, so thanks for doing that. Sharing a room is not required, but is often done because we all get along so well and work well together.

## Food and Transportion

Spend what you need to in order to get where you need to be and be effective and efficient and comfortable. This includes buses, trains, taxi cabs, subways, car rentals, airport parking, and car miles. Don't forget to eat. If the meal is work related or during an in-policy trip, it's covered. If you need to cover food for people not in this policy (such as a group meal where some but not all present are team members), ask the President or Executive Director in advance.

If you're not sure what's reasonable for travel and food on a daily basis, the U.S. Government publishes rates for all different cities of the world called 'per diem'. You can use these as a guide if you like. Our expectation is no one would need to exceed per diem on average, when following the guiding principle of this policy.

## Help

If you want to propose a covered expense or are not sure if an expense or trip is already budgeted or approved, ask the President or Executive Director.

If you're not in a position to incur the expense and get reimbursed within 30 days, talk to the President or Executive Director. We can make arrangements to pre-pay the expense.

## Reimbursement requests

Submit requests early and often using expensify.com to expenses@jquery.org. Each report should be for related expenses, such as single trip. Make sure you select the 'jQuery Expense Reports' policy. If you don't have access to it, send an email request to expenses@jquery.org.

Include a note in your first report or in a separate email to expenses@jquery.org to specify how you would like to be reimbursed. For available reimbursement methods, contact the President, Executive Director, or expenses@jquery.org.

Reimbursement requests must be received within 30 days of completion of the associated event. Reimbursements are processed on a 1-2 week basis. To be safe you should plan on being able to receive the reimbursement 3-4 weeks after the request is made. If this is an issue, see the Help section above.
